# üåê Portfolio App ‚Äî AWS EKS Fullstack Web Application

This project is a **modern fullstack web application** built with **React**, **Node.js (Express)**, and **AWS Cloud Services** such as **Cognito**, **EKS**, **S3**, and **CloudFront**.

## üöÄ Overview

The application consists of:
- A **React frontend** (SPA) deployed via **S3 + CloudFront**
- A **Node.js/Express backend API** running on **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**
- **AWS Cognito** for secure user authentication (login/logout)
- A **Contact form** connected to the backend API
- A **PrivateRoute system** that protects access to personal sections of the site
- Modern **responsive design** powered by **TailwindCSS**

This setup demonstrates how a developer can build, containerize, and deploy a secure, scalable, and fully cloud-native web application.

## üß≠ Website Structure & Flow

The website is designed as a clean, single-page application with multiple routes managed by **React Router DOM**.

### üåç Public Pages
Accessible to all visitors:
- `/` ‚Üí **Home / Hero Section**  
  Introduction of the developer, profile picture, and navigation buttons  
- `/contact` ‚Üí **Contact Form**  
  Visitors can send messages via a backend POST endpoint  

### üîí Protected Pages
Only visible to authenticated users:
- `/aboutme` 
  This page shows **personal or professional project data**, visible only after a **successful login** through AWS Cognito.  
  The protection is handled by a **custom PrivateRoute** component which checks if a valid user session exists.

If a visitor tries to access these protected routes without being logged in, they are automatically **redirected to the `/login` page**.

This section is intentionally **not publicly visible**.  
It becomes accessible only after authentication, ensuring that **private or professional details** are shared only with verified users (e.g., recruiters, clients, or collaborators).

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Details

The frontend is built with **React 18**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS** for a fast, modular, and modern development workflow.

### Key Components
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **App.jsx** | Main routing logic with React Router (`/`, `/projects`, `/contact`, `/login`) |
| **Navbar.jsx** | Sticky top navigation bar with conditional rendering for authenticated users |
| **Hero.jsx** | Landing page with personal introduction and quick navigation |
| **AboutMe.jsx** | Displays user projects fetched from the backend (protected route) |
| **Contact.jsx** | Contact form connected to the backend (`/contact` POST request) |
| **Login.jsx** | Login form using AWS Cognito authentication |
| **PrivateRoute.jsx** | Protects sensitive routes by verifying Cognito session before rendering |
| **Footer.jsx** | Footer section with copyright |
| **AuthContext.jsx** | Manages authentication state globally using AWS Amplify‚Äôs Auth module |
| **cognito.js** | AWS Amplify configuration (region, User Pool ID, and App Client ID) |
| **api.js** | Axios instance managing all API requests and automatic token attachment |

---

## üîê Authentication & Protected Routes

Authentication is handled by **AWS Cognito** through **AWS Amplify**.  
When a user logs in, Cognito returns an **ID token (JWT)** which is stored in `localStorage`.  

### Authentication Flow:
1. User logs in via `/login`
2. Cognito validates credentials and returns an ID token
3. The token is stored in `localStorage`
4. Axios automatically attaches this token as a Bearer header in every request
5. The **AuthContext** updates the global user state
6. Protected components (like `/projects` or `/about-me`) are only rendered if a valid user session exists

If no token or expired session is found, the user is **redirected to the login page**.

This ensures that personal information, such as the developer‚Äôs background or private project details, remains **hidden to the public**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Details

The backend is a lightweight **Express.js** API, containerized and deployed on **AWS EKS**.

### Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **GET** | `/health` | Health check (‚ÄúAPI l√§uft!‚Äù) |
| **GET** | `/projects` | Returns project data from `projects.js` |
| **POST** | `/contact` | Receives form submissions from the frontend and logs them |


### Features
- `express.json()` for JSON body parsing  
- `cors()` for secure cross-origin access  
- `.env` configuration with `dotenv`  
- Modular and ready for future expansion (database, email, etc.)

‚≠ê Final Note

This project demonstrates how to build a secure and scalable fullstack cloud application using AWS technologies.
It combines modern frontend design with a containerized backend and integrates AWS Cognito for authentication and role-based access.

Sensitive sections like About Me are protected and only visible to verified users ‚Äî showcasing how frontend security and backend authentication can be combined seamlessly in a professional cloud-native setup.

üéì Learning Purpose

This application was developed as a DevOps learning project, combining multiple cloud and web technologies into one workflow.
It serves as a hands-on foundation for understanding how modern web applications are built, containerized, deployed, and scaled in the cloud.

The project provides a strong base for further extensions ‚Äî such as adding CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, database integration, or automated infrastructure provisioning with Terraform or AWS CDK.

In summary, this web application is both a portfolio project and a DevOps training environment, demonstrating practical end-to-end cloud deployment principles using real AWS services.
